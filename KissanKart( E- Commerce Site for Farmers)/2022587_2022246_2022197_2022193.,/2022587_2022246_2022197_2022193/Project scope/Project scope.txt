1.1 Project Scope 
The project focuses on developing a mobile application tailored for the streamlined delivery of agricultural tools  and supplies to farmers, aiming to overcome the accessibility challenges faced by the agricultural community.  This comprehensive app will consist of two distinct interfaces: one catering to buyers (farmers) and the other  designed for sellers. Buyers can effortlessly register, select products, view fixed prices, and receive real-time  updates on their deliveries. On the seller side, the application provides a platform for registration, enabling  sellers to list products with detailed information and efficiently manage their inventory. The backend  infrastructure will leverage technologies such as Python, Django, and MySQL, while the frontend will be crafted  using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Additionally, the integration of the Google Maps API will ensure  precise location tracking. 
Key features include secure transaction handling, robust notifications, and seamless order processing. The  success criteria encompass achieving high user satisfaction, optimizing order processing efficiency, and  encouraging increased product listings by sellers. Regular milestone reviews will be conducted throughout the  project. Assumptions are made regarding sellers adhering to product listing guidelines. Overall, the project  seeks to create a user-friendly and transparent platform, fostering connections between farmers and essential  supplies, while empowering sellers to showcase their agricultural products effectively. 
The application's front end will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, while the backend  will be implemented using Python, MySQL, and Django.
